# S2T-Darija
Deep learning project using Pytorch. The main core of the mission is to convert speech with Moroccan dialect Darija to a text, aka. audio transcription. For instance, we have achieved a point where we guarantee the low-hanging fruit of the model which occurs in converting speech to text acoustically better but an awful lot of modifications must be done in text regard given as output to outperform better and hit the state of the art as using the last techniques in S2T based on XLSR approach to rank well by WER/PER
